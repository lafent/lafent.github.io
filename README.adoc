================

A scaffold for getting rolling with Jade, Twitter Bootstrap and Grunt.

This is just a setup for building a static site using:

*   Grunt Tasks
*   Node.js
*   Jade Templates
*   Twitter Bootstrap v3
*   jQuery and jQuery Tablesorter
*   Google Analytics

After you run the default grunt task you can ship the www directory to your 
web host and get on with life.  

Getting Started
---------------

You'll need http://git-scm.com/[git], http://nodejs.org/[node.js], and an
internet connection to get things rolling.

*NOTE* The examples provided are derived from the Twitter Bootstrap website
and are representative of their work and effort, not mine.

. `git clone https://github.com/lafent/grunt-and-done.git`
. `cd grunt-and-done`
. `npm install`
. `grunt` 

Now point your browser to http://localhost:3456/[http://localhost:3456/] and
view your website.

Todo
----

. Improve documentation.
. [line-through]*Setup production tasks in grunt, including uglify and concat 
  tasks.*
. Look at other grunt tasks that can be inlined.
. Look at usemin to handle configuring use of minified versions.
. Add other examples from the bootstrap examples page.
. Consider other basic libraries to add to the base. *Be critical of utility*

Reminder
--------

Please update the ga.js file to include the correct account code.
