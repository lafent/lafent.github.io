            <h3>Why, whatever do I mean?</h3>
            <p>
              At work we've been trying to introduce lighter options for
              helping faculty communicate.  Although we have a more heavy-weight
              option, faculty have requested a simpler setup, one that enables
              them to interact with their audiences more easily.
            </p>
            <div class="panel callout radius">
              The actual statement was that our standard template looks like
              a university website and they want something that looks bloggy.
            </div>
            <p>My first reaction was: What does that *even* mean?  </p>
            <p>
              I had to put aside my programmer brain for a minute, but then I 
              realized they meant that there was too much ceremony in the way
              and they wanted less fancy graphics and more communications in
              their blog.  Or, put another way, the signal-to-noise ratio was
              too high for their liking. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Now if you've ever worked at a university, you know that many 
              of the things we do aren't tied to a reason, but rather a policy.
              Sometimes the policies have good reasons, and sometimes... well, 
              not so much.
            </p>
            <p class="panel callout radius">
              Heck, in this case it's not even a policy, since policy has a
              very specific set of requirements in order to be a policy.
              However, for our uses policy gets the idea across.
            </p>
            <p>
              Anyway, so we have a policy that says we should use a specific
              template to maintain branding identity, uniformity, and a myriad
              of other good goals. But, like many good things, a bit too much 
              is still a bit too much.  So we have faculty who would like to 
              reach out to the people they're supposed to help and provide
              benefits to, but feel restricted and impared by the systems that 
              are supposed to enable those very efforts.  It's enough to make
              a person need a lie down.
            </p>
            <p>
              So what was the solution?  I mean we need the less ceremony 
              solution, but we need to main the policy happy at the same time.
            </p>
            <p>
              What we did was redesign the (very) desktop-centric, graphics 
              heavy template into a light weight, html5-based RWD-infused
              wordpress template.  Backed by Zurb's Foundation we started 
              with an article forward mentality, since the information was key.  
              We kept the graphics to a minimum with a icon set for most social
              media options and clean markup.  
            </p>
            <p>
              The whole process is based on a grunt task runner setup that 
              allows us to tweak Zurb's sass layout, recompile to css, and then
              (optionally) update the dev or prod instances.  The grunt task
              also includes an live demo site with a dummy layout so we can
              check things on the local developers machine before trying to 
              go to dev.  This has probably saved us a million headaches, but
              since we're not having them, it's hard to count!  
            </p>
            <p>
              Is it perfect?  No, far from it.  But is it better?  Oh my yes. 
              Miles and miles better.  You can interact usefully on a phone, 
              which easily opens up another communication channel and because
              we're text-centric, makes a lighter payload for those users.
            </p>
            <p>Want to discus what we did and how we went about it?</p>
            <p>Just shoot me an email, catch me on IRC, or hit me up on twitter.</p>
