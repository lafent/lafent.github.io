              So, at work we may be a bit atypical, but we've got several 
              WordPress installations that are actually networks of sites.
            </p>
            <div class="panel callout radius">
              There is actually a good reason they're separated, but it's more
              about business logic than programming logic.
            </div>
            <p>
              All was good for a while, but as the sites got more readers and 
              more spambots started to post, things started to get out out hand
              every blog post spawned dozens of comments. All the spam catchers
              in the world won't get it all, so dozens of comments were still
              coming through on a weekly basis.  The problem is that the blog
              authors aren't really interested in pruning that.
            </p>
            <p>
              When the comments pile is as high as an elephant's eye, what is
              clever admin to do?  That's right, write a dashboard widget.
            </p>
            <p>Which is just what I did.</p>
            <h4>Presenting</h4><a href="https://github.com/lafent/comms-dashboard/" class="button radius">Comms Dashboard</a>
            <p>
              Comms Dashboard only has one purpose, let an administrator see
              what blogs have comments that might need sorting out.  You can 
              configure things to only show blogs with comments in need of 
              attention, or, if you like pain, you can see all of your 
              subsites.
            </p>
            <div class="panel callout radius">
              I wouldn't run this on a large site without some testing, it
              could get snarly hammering the database for 1000+ sites.  Then
              again, if you're running a large site, you have your own pains
              to deal with.

              Want to discus what I did and how I went about it?  Have a 
              suggestion?
            </p>
            <p>Just shoot me an email, catch me on IRC, or hit me up on twitter.</p>
