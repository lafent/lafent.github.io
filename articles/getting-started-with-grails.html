            <p>
              I thought take a few minutes and jot down some of how I work
              with Grails, Groovy, and associated tools.
            </p>
            <h3>A Little Groundwork Before We Begin</h3>
            <p>
              So my goto tool for setting up a new environment (system) to
              work on with grails is to ensure that a JVM is available to me. 
              Typically I use a java-7 based jvm, but I haven't had any issues
              using the OpenJDK one vs. the Oracle one.  That's not saying 
              there aren't some issues, just that they haven't bitten me.
            </p>
            <h3>First Steps</h3>
            <p>Once the JDK is installed and available I install  <a href="http://gvmtool.net/">GVMTool </a>for convenience.  You can just download and install grails 
              directly, but since I have several grails projects involving 
              different versions of grails, I find the management features 
              from gvm to be too handy to ignore.
            </p>
            <p class="panel radius callout">
              GVM actually allows you to install a fair number of other 
              frameworks, but for today we'll just focus on grails.
            </p>
            <p>
              GVM works much like RVM (that inspired it) in that it allows you
              to keep different versions of grails available without having to
              manually juggle directory paths or make crazy changes to your 
              configuration.
            </p>
            <p>So, to kick things off, you can just run 
              <pre>gvm install grails</pre>and it will install the most recent version of grails into a set
              of private directories and ask you if you want to set that into
              your path. 
            </p>
            <p>From that point onward it's just standard grails, and that rocks!</p>
            <h3>A Few More Commands</h3>
            <P>
               
              If you have an older project you can install specific versions
              with 
              <pre>gvm install grails <version number></pre>Versions as far back as 1.2.0 are available.  
            </P>
            <p>Need to know what version you have installed? 
              <pre>gvm list grails</pre>is your friend.  Installed versions are marked as well as the 
              version that is currently installed.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now that you know what version you're on, and you have the
              version you need installed, how do you switch? Easy, 
              <pre>gvm use grails <version></pre>and you're ready to go.
            </p>
            <h3>Summary for GVM (TL;DR)</h3>
            <p>GVM makes managing grails (and other projects) dropdead simple.</p>
